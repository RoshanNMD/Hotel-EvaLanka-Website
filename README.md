## Introduction
This web design is designed for a existing web application called "Hotel Eva Lanka". This is a university project and this web design is built for academic purpose only. In this project, the web designers have to redesigned a web design for a selected existing web application's web design which has bad user experience with low customer satisfaction.

The existing Hotel Eva Lanka web design has the following issues.
1. **Font size to too small to read for the user**.
2. **Every paragraph is left aligned**.
3. **Content is not enough for the guests or customers**.
4. **High Quality Photographs are not used**.
5. **Bad navigation structure**.
6. **Structure of content of the web page is not well managed**.
7. **When a customer click the logo on navigation bar, the page is redirecting to the same page. (After clicking the logo, it should be redirected to the home page)**.
8. **In home page, some links are not working**.
9. **Color scheme used in existing web design is not attractive**.
10.**No searching feature included**.

So we have come up with a better design by answering the above mentioned issues using some modern technology and knowledge. This project is for that. Thank you.

## I have used the following fonts

1. For main topics :- Edwardian Script ITC
2. For paragraphs :- Nunito
